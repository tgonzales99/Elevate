McKell Purnell is a careers strategist and the creator of the ELEVATE! Career Advancement Program--a transformative system that helps driven professionals stop waiting and start winning by intentionally scheduling their next job promotion.

Born in poverty in the Caribbean, McKell’s story is one of resilience and reinvention. An immigrant who came to the U.S.
for graduate school, she has successfully reinvented her career four times: as a teacher, actuary, consultant, and now
executive. Along the way, she’s worked at both a Big 4 accounting firm and a Fortune 100 company, gaining a 360-
degree view of the corporate ladder—and the invisible rules that shape who gets ahead.


McKell blends analytical rigor with heartfelt leadership. She holds a Master of Actuarial Science from Georgia State
University’s J. Mack Robinson College of Business and an Advanced Executive HR Certification from the University of
Michigan. A Distinguished Toastmaster, she’s also recognized for her excellence in communication and leadership.


Her ELEVATE! program draws from her personal journey and her work coaching high-potential professionals, turning
professional branding into a strategic superpower. McKell believes your career is not just about advancement—it’s about
unlocking the life you were meant to live. Her message is bold and electrifying:

“When you're stuck in your mind, you're stuck in your life. Promotion starts long before someone says ‘yes’—it begins the
moment you see yourself differently.”


Victory teaches that your current role is your best training ground and that your work is your gift to the world. Her
interactive, practical, and deeply personal sessions help professionals clarify their brand, raise their visibility, and align
with the opportunities they deserve.


Today, she lives a life nothing like the one she was born into—and her mission is to help others create the same kind of
transformation.


Come ready to be inspired—and to leave with the a plan.

          <p>Sheâ€™s worked at a Big 4 firm and a Fortune 100 company, coached high-potential professionals, and knows exactly how the game is playedâ€”and how to help you rise.</p>

          <p><strong>When you're stuck in your mind, you're stuck in your life. Promotion starts long before someone says â€˜yesâ€™â€”it begins the moment you see yourself differently.</strong></p>
